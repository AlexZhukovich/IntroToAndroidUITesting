The application was created for improving skills (from the very beginning) in testing Android application use Espresso framework. Each screen contains UI elements which are used by many applications.

  <img src="/art/screenshots/home_screen_framed.png" height="500" />

</p>

This is the first application from the workshop "Creating Robust UI tests in Android" which allows everyone to learn the basics of Espresso:
* How to test separate screen in Android application
* How to interact with Android Views
* How to verify Settings screen in Android application
* How to create custom matchers and work efficiently with Espresso framework
* How to create custom actions which allow interacting with child view

# Structure of the project
The project has two main branches
* master
* solutions

The **master** branch has failed test cases which should be created from scratch. 
Each test case has a comment with a description of the test case and a hint (what can be used for implementing it).

The **solutions** branch has solutions for all test cases.

***Note:** In case if any of description is not understandable, please create an issue.*
